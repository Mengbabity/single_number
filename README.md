# single_number

#C++
using the XOR(^)(by digit).The figure appears two times then the result will be 0.the single one will be left.
The method is brilliant.And the complexity of time is O(n).

#Java
This is my method.If the figure appears the second time,the inner for-cycle will break.Then we test next figure.If the figure
is single,the different times will be length-i+1,so we pick it up.
O(n^2) again.
